# GitHub Flow Demo

This file demonstrates the new GitHub Flow setup for diffx.

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

1. **Branch Protection**: Main branch is now protected
   - Requires PR reviews (1 approval)
   - CI checks must pass
   - Stale reviews are dismissed

2. **Issue Labels**: Comprehensive labeling system
   - Priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Types (bug, feature, docs, refactor, performance)
   - Status tracking (in-progress, blocked, ready-for-review)
   - Difficulty levels (good-first-issue, easy, medium, hard)
   - Area tags (core, cli, npm, pypi, docs)

3. **Git Hooks**: Pre-push validation enabled
   - Runs `./scripts/ci-local.sh` before every push
   - Ensures code quality and test coverage

4. **Development Workflow**: GitHub Flow implemented
   - Feature branches required for all changes
   - PR-based development process
   - Automated quality checks

## ðŸš€ Test Workflow

This file was created on the `feature/test-github-flow` branch to demonstrate the new workflow.

When this PR is created, it will:
- Trigger CI checks
- Require review before merge
- Test the branch protection rules
- Validate the new development process

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Complete this PR to validate the workflow
2. Update team on new development process
3. Create first real feature using the new flow
4. Monitor and refine the process as needed
