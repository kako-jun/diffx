        I would like diffx to:
        1. Detect binary files automatically
        2. Provide a --binary flag for explicit binary comparison
        3. Output differences in hexadecimal format
        
        Example usage:
        ```bash
        diffx binary1.dat binary2.dat --binary
        ```

      required: true
